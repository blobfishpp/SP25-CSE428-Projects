Here’s how you would do this:
Step 1: Determine the direction and patient Id. These are given.

Step 2: Determine Using MLO: Upper, Lower, or Middle
To do this, draw a coordinate system. You need to first locate the center point of the chest wall side (the side closer to the body — rib cage, bones), and then locate the nipple (the protrusion on the breast). Connect these two points to form the x-axis. The y-axis is defined as perpendicular to the chest wall side, not necessarily perpendicular to the x-axis. This coordinate system is different from the traditional one — the x and y axes do not have to be perpendicular.
At this point, the breast is divided into upper and lower quadrants: If the tumor lies on the x-axis, it's considered MIDDLE. If the tumor lies above the x-axis, it's UPPER. If the tumor lies below the x-axis, it's LOWER.

Step 3: Determine using CC outer (lateral) or inner (medial) or middle
To do this, draw a coordinate system. You need to first locate the nipple (the protrusion on the breast), and then locate the chest wall side (the side closer to the body — rib cage, bones). From the nipple, draw a perpendicular line to the chest wall side — this line becomes the x-axis. The y-axis is defined along the chest wall side.
At this point, the breast is divided into left and right quadrants: If the tumor lies on the x-axis, it's considered MIDDLE. If the tumor lies above the x-axis, it's OUTER (lateral). If the tumor lies below the x-axis, it's INNER (medial).

Step 4: Further Classification on MLO Using Clock-Face Position (Based on Angle)
Building upon the coordinate system used for MLO and the quadrant determination (UPPER or LOWER), we can further divide each quadrant based on angle, simulating four regions on a clock face: 12–3 o’clock, 3–6 o’clock, 6–9 o’clock, or 9–12 o’clock.
We use the results from the previous three steps to determine which specific clock-face region the tumor is in.
You can imagine each breast as a clock.
For example:
On the left breast:
Upper outer = 12–3 o’clock
Lower outer = 3–6 o’clock
Lower inner = 6–9 o’clock
Upper inner = 9–12 o’clock
On the right breast:
Upper inner = 12–3 o’clock
Lower inner = 3–6 o’clock
Lower outer = 6–9 o’clock
Upper outer = 9–12 o’clock
If we further divide the 12–3 o’clock region into three parts by angle, they become:
12–1
1–2
2–3
We can then estimate the tumor’s position more precisely.
If the tumor is labeled MIDDLE in MLO, it might correspond to 3:00 or 9:00, depending on the side and which breast it is.
If the tumor is large or spans multiple regions, we should use the median location or the most dense area as the reference point.
If you're unsure exactly which clock hour the tumor aligns with, you can use decimal points —
for example:
Between 9 and 10 o’clock → 9.5
Between 12 and 1 o’clock → 12.5

Step 5: Adjustment of Clock Position Due to Compression (Using MULD)
Because the breast may be compressed during imaging, we need to adjust the clock position we initially determined.
Generally, we use the MULD method — Medial Up, Lateral Down.
If in Step 4 you have a decimal clock position, round to the closest integer (based on MULD). If the tumor lies exactly on a clock line (e.g., 3 or 9, no decimal), then round to the next integer (based on MULD).
If the tumor is in the inner (medial) region, we round down (toward the top of the clock).
Note: This is not a simple floor function. It’s based on simulating a clock face. 
For example:
9.5 rounds down to 9
3.5 rounds down to 4
9 rounds down to 8
If the tumor is in the outer (lateral) region, we round up (toward the bottom of the clock).
For example:
9.5 rounds up to 10
3.5 rounds up to 3
9 rounds up to 8
For boundary values, no adjustment is needed:
6 o’clock is the lowest position, so no rounding down is required.
12 o’clock is the highest position, so no rounding up is required.
